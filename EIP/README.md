#### It is a crazy amalgamation of three distinct ideas that emerge out of our keen interest in exsisting technologies. Our interest for internet dates back to when we could only send emails to friends and see photos of stuff.

What the internet of today probably lacks is trust for thing that exsist in the internet. Best way a human being can feel and judge a product is to see it, touch it & most importantly feel it. Since such ways over internet are yet to be successfully deployed, next big trust is build up if poeple share their own views about products whcih we can only see in the internet. 

`We a propose a peer to peer review system which can be used as a platform to judge things that exist in the internet and will allow people
to share their honest thoughts abot a product yet remain anaomymous (if one chooses to be). 
Peer to peer review system works by puting transactions (in the form of upvotes, review rank updation, product ranking improvements etc) 
into a chain of review blocks timestamped bya distributed stratum level0 server after proof of consensus over the real transaction.
User gets to choose the product they want to write a review on and then express their honest view about the product. Each time an upvote-
downvote, product ranking change etc is detected, it is put into a block and chained into a tree of hashes. The review blocks are 
discovered by the network which runs a contract to establish a PoC on the block and puts it into the blockchain.`

#### We will bring the best & most helpful review to the people that people can really trust. We gain confidence of the person which inturn increases the product rating. 

We ask `What will make a review write a review? Or Why will someone write a review?`.
Simple, incentives, which will become high enough taht he can live his life reviewing products. He/She writes good reviews which gets
a upvotes or is cited anywhere else helps to earn incentives.

#### What we will do?
We will make a platform for writing reviews and upvoting products. Incentives are gained in the form of a coin which we propoe to bring in 
trade by putting in an ICO. Supported by a whitepaper along with a roadmap which explains completely the extexts, methods, technical
framework, ReviewRanking, ProductCitations and lots more. End effect is to incentivise the reviewer to write a good review and bring out 
the best product based on ProductCitations algorithm.
