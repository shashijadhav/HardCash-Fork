### It is a crazy amalgamation of three distinct ideas that emerge out of our keen interest in exsisting technologies. Our interest for internet dates back to when we could only send emails to friends and see photos of stuff.
What the internet of today probably lacks is trust for thing that exsist in the internet. Best way a human being can feel and judge a product is to see it, touch it & most importantly feel it. Since ways today the same over internet has yet been successfully deployed, next big trust is build up if poeple share their own views about products whcih we can only see in the internet. 

```bash
We a propose a peer to peer review system which can be used as a platform to judge things that exist in the internet and will allow people
to share their honest thoughts abot a product yet remain anaomymous (if one chooses to be). 
Peer to peer review system works by puting 
transactions (in the form of upvotes, review rank updation, product ranking improvements etc) into a chain of review blocks timestamped by
a distributed stratum level0 server after proof of consensus over the real transaction. User get to choose the product they want to write
a review on and then express their honest view about the product. Each time an upvote-downvote, product ranking change etc is detected, 
it is put into a block and chained into a tree of hashes. The review blocks are discovered by the network which runs a contract
